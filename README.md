# This will be my first published iOS app...
I have made a web app and an Android app (with Godot) in the past, but since I finally have a computer that can handle native app development, I figure I should give it a try. After this I will try to make an Android app in Android Studio.

Since, Apple is notoriously more difficult (for a lot of reasons) I figure I should do this first. 

As of today's date: <b>2023, September 10th</b>, I am still a student 6 classes away from graduation, (est: before 2024, June) and honestly don't know what I want to do, but figure I should start making projects I want to make, and since iOS devs are more rare I'll focus that as a platform. For now it will just be the UI I use, but I will do PostgreSQL, Redis, and Blockchain as a DB and use Bun.js to be the glue... 

Those are my goals anyway...
